    <h1>Visual AWR Readme - v02h</h1>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Stephen Furlong, steve.furlong@oracle.com</p>
    <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong>
    The Visual AWR toolkit provides fine grained graphical trend analysis for
    Oracle Database AWR (Automatic Workload Repository) and OSWatcher/ExaWatcher
    performance metrics. AWR & OSWatcher/ExaWatcher metrics are collected automatically
    by Oracle systems.  This raw data can be difficult to interpret unless aggregated
    over multiple days and charted for trend and root cause analysis.
    VisualAWR is intended for use by experienced DBAs and performance
    engineers to diagnose workload performance issues and inform platform
    capacity planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Acknowledgement:</strong>
       This project owes a debt to the seminal database performance work
      done by Tyler Muth from Oracle. Specifically his work with the AWRMiner
      project was leveraged as a guide for the SQL queries used to extract
      data from the Oracle AWR tables.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong><br/>
    1.  Visual AWR is not supported or endorsed by Oracle. &nbsp;It was developed
       independently by me and is intended for experienced Oracle DBAs and
       performance engineers.<br/>
    2.  An Oracle Database Diagnostic Pack License is required.  This script queries DBA_HIST_ views
        in the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR). To generate AWR
        reports, take AWR snapshots, or queries these views requires a
        license for the Diagnostic Pack from Oracle.  If you are not sure whether you
        are licensed to for the Diagnostic Pack, contact your Oracle sales rep or support.

    <h2>Quick Start</h2>
    <p>
       See my
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CINrQkQOPWE">
        <b>video guide on YouTube</b></a>
       and my blog <a href="http://visualawr.blogspot.com"><b>here.</b></a>
    </p>

    This tool will chart AWR performance metrics by directly attaching to the
    database or by reading the output file from an AWRMiner collection script.
     AWR performance metrics can be visualized from one of two data sources:
    JDBC Connection or from an AWRMiner text file.
    <h3>Charting AWR metrics from a JDBC Connection</h3>
     1. Connect to the target database using the DB Connections screen below and
    save the connection.<br/>

    <p>2. Use the Chart DB Data wizard to collect the AWR snapshot data and
       chart the metrics.</p>

    <p>3. Follow the wizard and chart the specific metrics you are interested in.</p>

    <h3>Charting AWR metrics from an AWRMiner collection file.</h3>
     1. Choose a valid AWRMiner output file and select a metric to chart.<br/>
