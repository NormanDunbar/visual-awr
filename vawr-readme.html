<h1>Visual&nbsp;AWR&nbsp;-&nbsp; Readme</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>NOTE1:</strong>
       &nbsp;Visual AWR is not supported or endorsed by Oracle. &nbsp;It was
      developed independenly by me and is inteded for experienced DBAs and
      performance engineers.

<h2>Diagnostic Pack License Required</h2>This script queries DBA_HIST_ views in
                                         the Automatic Workload Repository
(AWR). To generate AWR reports, take AWR snapshots, or queries these views
requires a license for the Diagnostic Pack (<a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E16655_01/license.121/e17614/options.htm#DBLIC165"
 target="_blank">12.1 document</a>, <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/license.112/e10594/options.htm#CIHIHDDJ"
 target="_blank">11.2 document</a> or <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/license.102/b14199/options.htm#sthref76" target="_blank">10.2
document</a>). You should NOT run this script on any Database that is not
licensed for the Diagnostic Pack .

<p>
       This tool queries the AWR repository and gathers key database
      metrics from each AWR snapshot over the last n days. These metrics can
      assist in sizing and tuning excercises. An AWR report provides much more
      detailed metrics but only between 2 snapshots. This script and the
      subsequent graphs produced from its data provide higher level aggregate
      data over a longer period of time.</p>
