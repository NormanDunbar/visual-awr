<h1>Visual&nbsp;AWR&nbsp;-&nbsp; Readme</h1>

<p>Author: Stephen Furlong, steve.furlong@oracle.com</p>

    <p>
       Visual AWR is not supported or endorsed by Oracle. &nbsp;It was
      developed independenly by me and is inteded for experienced DBAs and
      performance engineers.
    </p>

<p>This project is made possible by the seminal database performance work done by Tyler Muth from Oracle.  
Specifically his work with the AWRMiner project was leveraged as a guide for the SQL queries needed to extract data from the Oracle AWR tables.

<h3>Diagnostic Pack License Required</h3>This script queries DBA_HIST_ views in
                                         the Automatic Workload Repository
(AWR). To generate AWR reports, take AWR snapshots, or queries these views
requires a license for the Diagnostic Pack (<a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E16655_01/license.121/e17614/options.htm#DBLIC165"
 target="_blank">12.1 document</a>, <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/license.112/e10594/options.htm#CIHIHDDJ"
 target="_blank">11.2 document</a> or <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/license.102/b14199/options.htm#sthref76" target="_blank">10.2
document</a>). You should NOT run this script on any Database that is not
licensed for the Diagnostic Pack .

This tool will chart AWR performance metrics by directly attaching to the database or by reading the 
output file from an AWRMiner collection script.
      <h3>Quick Start</h3>
AWR performance metrics can be visualized from one of two data sources:  JDBC Connection or from an AWRMiner text file.

<h3>Collecting AWR metrics from a JDBC Connection  </h3>
1.  Connect to the target database using the DB Connections screen below and save the connection.

<p>2.  Use the Chart DB Data wizard to collect the AWR snapshot data and chart the metrics.
